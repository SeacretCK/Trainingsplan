This is my first full stack MEVN App. Besides MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node it's using Mongoose, Axios, Moment and Vue-Toasted. The styling is done with Sass and with mobile usage in mind. 
This app is meant to be used during your workout at the gym, where you can record your progress for each exercise you do. When you open up one exercise it shows you the details of your last session. So when you don't change the weight or repetitions you can just hit save and it stores the data anew with the current date. You can look at the statistics of each exercise to track your progress.

I have many more features in mind for this app, like grouping the exercises, sorting them, checking them off once you saved your sets for the day or analysing your progress with diagrams. So this is a work in progress.
